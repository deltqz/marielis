Astro content collections make it easy to publish structured articles quickly. Each post includes consistent frontmatter, so listings and metadata stay reliable.

## Quick update workflow

1. Create a new file in `src/content/blog/`.
2. Add `title`, `description`, and `pubDate` in frontmatter.
3. Write the article body in Markdown or MDX.
4. Start the dev server and verify the post appears in `/blog`.

This setup keeps your newsroom publishing flow simple while preserving fast page performance.
