	<p>
		Daily Orbit News is a small digital newsroom built to publish clear, practical reporting about
		technology, climate, and local life.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site runs on Astro and Markdown content collections, so publishing a new article is as simple
		as adding a new file in the content folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		Coverage is intentionally lightweight and readable, with straightforward article pages and a
		chronological news feed.
